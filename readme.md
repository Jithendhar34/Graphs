# Graph Class

This `Graph` class is a simple implementation of an **undirected graph** using an **adjacency list**. The class allows you to manage vertices and edges, and provides methods for adding vertices, adding edges between vertices, and printing the graph structure.

## Features

- **Add Vertex**: You can add a new vertex to the graph. If the vertex already exists, it will not be added again.
- **Add Edge**: You can add an undirected edge between two existing vertices. This creates a two-way connection between the vertices.
- **Print Graph**: The graph can be printed as an adjacency list, displaying each vertex and its corresponding adjacent vertices.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher is required to run this class.

## Usage

To use the `Graph` class, instantiate an object of the class and utilize its methods to build your graph. You can add vertices, connect them with edges, and print the structure of the graph.

### Key Methods

- **addVertex(String vertex)**  
  Adds a new vertex to the graph. Returns `true` if the vertex was successfully added, or `false` if the vertex already exists.

- **addEdge(String vertex1, String vertex2)**  
  Adds an undirected edge between two vertices. Both vertices must already exist in the graph. Returns `true` if the edge was successfully added, or `false` if either vertex does not exist.

- **printGraph()**  
  Prints the entire graph as an adjacency list, showing each vertex and the list of vertices that are directly connected to it.

## Example Workflow

1. **Add Vertices**: You can add as many vertices as you need to the graph. Each vertex is represented by a string (e.g., "A", "B", "C", etc.).

2. **Add Edges**: After adding vertices, you can connect them by adding edges. For an undirected graph, an edge between two vertices will automatically add a connection from both vertices to each other.

3. **Print the Graph**: Once you have added vertices and edges, you can print the graph to see the connections between the vertices.

### Example Output

When you print the graph, it will be displayed as an adjacency list, which might look something like this:

```
{A=[B], B=[A, C], C=[B]}
```

In this example:
- Vertex "A" is connected to "B".
- Vertex "B" is connected to both "A" and "C".
- Vertex "C" is connected to "B".
